## Hi there 👋

Fluent-QA is focused on doing Development/QA/Software Testing practical.

Practical in Fluent-QA means:

- Different circumstances, different solutions
- Embrace existing tools and ideas to solve your real problem
- Embrace new ideas, where are new ideas coming from? New Reality, whether it is good or bad. 
- No Perfect solution only trade-off
- Better understanding of both reality and tech to work out

Practical also means Not only as QA but also doing anything to help solving issues you faced. 
Why QA can do so:
1. Have overview of the system,process, etc.
2. More different teams to work with, more detail oriented, more experience in handling different teams' interest

Why QA can't do so:

-  you might have not good enough coding skill.

So let's improve ourself.
