## Hi there 👋

Fluent-QA is focused on doing QA/Software Testing practical. 

Practical in Fluent-QA means:

- Different circumstances, different solutions
- Embrace existing tools and ideas to solve your real problem
- Embrace new ideas, where are new ideas coming from? New Reality, whether it is good or bad. 
- No Perfect solution only trade-off
- Better understanding of both reality and tech to work out

I'm from China without any oversea experience. My English is not fluent, but I hope codes can tell something else.

Practical also means Not only as QA but also doing anything to help solving issues you faced. 
Here is advantage of QA to do so:
1. Have overall view of the system,process, etc.
2. More details experienced,more different teams to work with

The disadvantage is that you might have not good enough coding skill. So let's improve ourself.
