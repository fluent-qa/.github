## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Fluent-QA is focused on doing Development/QA/Software Testing practically.
Fluent-QA is also for telling the real stories about Software QA in Chinese Companies.

***Practical in Fluent-QA means:***

- Different circumstances, different solutions
- Embrace existing tools and ideas to solve your real problem
- No Perfect solution only trade-off
- Better understanding of both reality and 

***Not Only Software QA but also to give some advice and feedback to team***:

Why QA can do so:

1. Work with a lot of different teams, better unstanding of other team's reality, always prioritize things
2. Easy to communicate with both dev or business unit guy
3. Have eought knowledge to explain tech stuff to no-tech member

Why QA can't do so:

-  you might have not good enough coding skill
-  you might not understand the problem or issue very well
-  you might be shame to say your thoughts
-  you might be have no idea about how to move thing forward, just wait for the commands
